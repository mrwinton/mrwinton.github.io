      <p>
        He's a problem solver - usually, with code - often with
        beer. Half-joking aside, he works with teams to break down big
        problems into smaller bite-sized ones.

      <p>
        Not as often as he'd like :)

        Hailing from <span class="inline-block transform rotate-180 transition duration-700 ease-out transform group-hover:rotate-0">Wellington, New Zealand</span>,
        I now live in Stockholm, Sweden. Day-to-day you may find me
        climbing, exploring, and running around the city.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In what seems like a past life, I had the pleasure of studying
        Software Engineering with the talented folks at Victoria
        University and Uppsala University.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Professionally, I've developed systems with the Reserve Bank
        of New Zealand, lead client projects at the wonderful
        Powershop, and I currently work at Promote International
        building applications for training professionals.
