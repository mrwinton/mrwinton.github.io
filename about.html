      <p class="mt-0">
        He's a problem solver -usually with code- often with
        beer. Half-joking aside, he works with teams to break down big
        problems into smaller bite-sized ones.

        Not as often as he'd like :)

        Hailing from <span class="inline-block transform rotate-180">Wellington, New Zealand</span>,
        I now live in Stockholm, Sweden. Day-to-day you may find me exploring,
        climbing, and running around the city.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        Professionally, I've developed systems with the Reserve Bank of New
        Zealand, lead client projects at Powershop, steered frontend migrations
        at Promote International and currently I work at Velory.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        In what seems like a past life, I had the pleasure of studying Software
        Engineering with the talented folks at Victoria University and Uppsala
        University.
