    Hello, I'm Michael.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a problem solver - usually, with code - often with beer. Half-joking aside, I work with teams to break down big problems into smaller bite-sized ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hailing from <i>windy</i> Wellington, and now based in <i>stunning</i> Stockholm. I studied with the talented folks at Victoria University and Uppsala University.
  </p>

  <p>
    Day to day you'll find me climbing, exploring, and running around the city.
  </p>
