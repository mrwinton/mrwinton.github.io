> Good Code.

For something I'm so fixated on I find it particularly strange that I have no
real definition for what _it_ is. This is a first attempt to remedy that.

**What is Good Code?** Well, I'd hazard that it:

1. Addresses the needs of users
   - provides value
   - is shipped
   - has an audience

1. Addresses the needs of maintainers
   - provides value
   - empowers changes
   - welcoming to new maintainers

1. Is _good_
   - doesn't leave the world worse off

I understand that this answer is a hand wave with the details not
detailed. But it may still be preferable when compared to the first draft of
this post:

> **Good Code,** it depends.
