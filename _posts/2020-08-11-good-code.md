"It's not Good Code", a mantra I hear as I self-edit whatever I'm
working on. Perhaps this sounds familiar?

For something I'm so fixated on achieving I find it particularly
strange that I have no real reference for what _it_ means. This is a
first attempt to remedy that.

**What is Good Code?** Well, I'd hazard that it:

1. Addresses the needs of users

    ☑ provides value

    ☑ is shipped

    ☑ has an audience

1. Addresses the needs of maintainers

     ☑ provides value

     ☑ empowers changes

     ☑ welcoming to new maintainers

1. Is _good_

     ☑ doesn't leave the world worse off

Well now, good code doesn't sound so intimidating when we identify its
stakeholders — the consumers, the creators, the context in which they
operate — and list their needs.

I understand that this answer is more an outline than a prescription;
however, it may yet comfort when compared with the first draft of this
post:

> **What is Good Code?** It depends.

P.S. Replace "Code" with your *\<X\>* and I think the principles will hold.
