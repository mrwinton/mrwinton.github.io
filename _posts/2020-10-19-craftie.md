While enjoying a beer recently I was reminiscing about the time I built an app
called Craftie.

Back in 2012 the craft beer scene in New Zealand was going to the moon, and
living in the craft beer capital of this movement found younger me captivated.

There was just one snag. With the breweries experimenting at such a dizzying
pace it was hard to keep track of the beers I really liked. What to do? Email?
Pigeon? Fax?

"I can fix this", thought younger me. Enter Craftie.

The idea was simple. Bars could manage their tap lists online and customers
would get notifications on their phones when bars or beers they follow are
restocked.

I thought this would take a few weekends. This was an understatement to say the
least.

Undaunted, I sent an email to Volstead one of my favourite bars nestled away in
Christchurch. It went something along the lines of:

> Hi,
>
> I'm thinking of building an app that would allow customers to get
> notifications for when beers they like are back in stock.
>
> Would you like this?
>
> Cheers and beers,
> Michael

The reply was enthusiastic.

Happy with the due diligence and my product/market fit established, I set off.

I recall that in 2012 I had experience with building sites using Laravel/Vue.js
so I whipped up an MVP without too much fuss.

With the ability to manage tap lists all set, I needed the mobile apps to send
the notifications to. A slight rub was that I had neither heads nor tails on the
whys and whats of iOS development.

Slightly daunted, I cobbled together a first iteration of Craftie.

Well, I wasn't going to win any design awards. But on the upside it worked and
there was plenty of space to improve! V2 was a bit more kind to the eyes I
think:

It was with slight relief and sadness when [Untappd](https://untappd.com) came
out with notification functionality in it's app. I discontinued development soon
after, chalking it up as a lot of fun and good learning. As the saying goes
"there's nothing new under the sun".

Now in 2020 I visit [Volstead's site](https://www.volstead.co.nz/) to see how
they're doing. The beers still look fantastic. It's cool to see that the tap
list is online. I see some light grey text at the bottom of the list: "powered
by Untappd". No tears are shed, I swear.
